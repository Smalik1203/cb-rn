## 🔍 Finding Issues

### If It Fails
Look for these markers:
- `❌` - Error occurred
- `⚠️` - Warning (validation failed)
- `💥` - Exception caught

### Common Errors You'll See

#### 1. School Code Missing
```
❌ School code is missing!
```
**Fix**: User needs school_code in their profile

#### 2. Not Authenticated
```
❌ No auth token found!
```
**Fix**: Sign out and sign back in

#### 3. Not Super Admin
```
❌ Request failed: Forbidden - Not a super admin
```
**Fix**: Update user role to 'superadmin'

#### 4. Database Error
```
❌ Request failed: Database error creating new user
```
**Fix**: Check RLS policies (already fixed in your case!)

## 📋 What to Check

When debugging, look for:

1. **Form Data**
   - Are all fields populated?
   - Is password at least 6 characters?

2. **User Profile**
   - Is role = 'superadmin'?
   - Does school_code exist?

3. **Request**
   - Is URL correct?
   - Is auth token present?
   - Does payload have all fields?

4. **Response**
   - What's the status code?
   - What's the error message?
   - Is there a debug object?

## 🎓 Understanding the Logs

### Delimiter Lines
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
```
These separate major sections - easy to scan!

### Emojis Guide
- 🎯 = UI action
- 📝 = Form data
- 👤 = User info
- 🏫 = School info
- 🔐 = Authentication
- ✅ = Success
- ❌ = Error
- ⚠️ = Warning
- 🚀 = Starting
- 📤 = Sending
- 📥 = Receiving
- 📊 = Result
- ⏱️ = Timing
- 🎉 = Celebration
- 🔄 = Refresh
- 💥 = Exception

### Security
Passwords are always shown as `[REDACTED]` in logs for security.

---

## 🧹 Production Cleanup

These logs are helpful for debugging but can be removed later:

### Option 1: Keep Them
- Useful for ongoing debugging
- Can filter console in production

### Option 2: Remove Them
Simply delete the `console.log()` statements from both files

### Option 3: Make Conditional
```typescript
if (__DEV__) {
  console.log('Debug info');
}
```
