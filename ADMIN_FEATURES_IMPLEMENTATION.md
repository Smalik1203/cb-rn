## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### New Hooks Created

#### 1. **useAdmins.ts** - Admin Management
```typescript
- useAdmins(schoolCode) - Fetch all admins
- useCreateAdmin(schoolCode) - Create via Edge Function
- useUpdateAdmin(schoolCode) - Update admin details
- useDeleteAdmin(schoolCode) - Delete via Edge Function
```

#### 2. **useAcademicYears.ts** - Academic Year Management
```typescript
- useAcademicYears(schoolCode) - Fetch all years
- useCreateAcademicYear(schoolCode) - Create new year
- useUpdateAcademicYear(schoolCode) - Update year details
- useDeleteAcademicYear(schoolCode) - Delete with dependency check
```

#### 3. **useClassInstances.ts** - Class Management
```typescript
- useClassInstances(schoolCode) - Fetch all classes
- useCreateClassInstance(schoolCode) - Create new class
- useUpdateClassInstance(schoolCode) - Update class details
- useDeleteClassInstance(schoolCode) - Delete class
```

#### 4. **useSubjects.ts** - Subject Management
```typescript
- useSubjects(schoolCode) - Fetch, create, update, delete subjects
- All operations return mutation functions for CRUD
```

### Navigation Updates

#### DrawerContent.tsx
Added new "Admin" section with 4 menu items:
- 🚀 Setup School (with "New" badge)
- 👥 Add Admins
- 📚 Add Classes
- 📖 Add Subjects

All items are **role-restricted to Super Admin only**.

#### _layout.tsx
Added 4 new tab screens with conditional rendering:
- Only visible when `showSuperAdminTabs = true`
- Automatically hidden for non-super admin users

---

## 🎨 Design System Integration

All screens use your existing design system:
- ✅ **Colors**: Primary, success, info, error palettes
- ✅ **Typography**: Consistent font sizes and weights
- ✅ **Spacing**: Standard spacing tokens
- ✅ **Shadows**: Elevation for cards and buttons
- ✅ **Components**: Card, Button, Input, Badge, EmptyState
- ✅ **ThreeStateView**: Loading, error, empty states

---

## 🔐 Security & Access Control

### Role-Based Access
- All screens check `profile?.role === 'superadmin'`
- Non-super admins see "Access Denied" message
- School code validation on all operations
- Edge Functions used for secure auth operations

### Data Validation
- ✅ Required field validation
- ✅ Format validation (email, phone, year)
- ✅ Duplicate detection
- ✅ Dependency checking before deletion
- ✅ Minimum length requirements

---

## 📦 Required Dependencies

You need to install one additional package:

```bash
npm install @react-native-picker/picker
# or
expo install @react-native-picker/picker
```

This is used for the native dropdown selectors in the Add Classes screen.

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Super Admins:

1. **Initial Setup Flow**:
   ```
   Setup School → Add Admins → Add Classes → Add Subjects → Enroll Students
   ```

2. **Daily Operations**:
   - Use drawer menu to navigate to admin features
   - All features available in the "Admin" section

3. **Navigation**:
   - Open drawer (swipe from left or tap menu icon)
   - Navigate to "Admin" section
   - Select desired feature

### For Regular Admins/Students:
- Admin features are completely hidden
- No access to super admin routes
- Existing dashboard and features remain unchanged

---

## 🔄 Data Flow

```
User Action
    ↓
React Query Hook
    ↓
Supabase Client / Edge Function
    ↓
Database
    ↓
React Query Cache Update
    ↓
UI Re-render
```

All data operations use React Query for:
- Automatic caching
- Background refetching
- Optimistic updates
- Error handling
- Loading states

## 📱 Mobile-Specific Optimizations

1. **Touch Targets**: All buttons and touchable areas are 44x44pt minimum
2. **Scrollable**: All screens support vertical scrolling
3. **Modals**: Bottom sheets could be added for better mobile UX
4. **Keyboard**: Proper keyboard avoidance and dismissal
5. **Loading States**: Skeleton screens and spinners
6. **Error Handling**: User-friendly alerts and messages

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **No Bulk Import**: Unlike the web version, mobile doesn't have Excel/CSV bulk import (would require native file picker)
2. **No Export**: No data export functionality (can be added with expo-file-system)
3. **Limited Sorting**: Tables don't have column sorting (mobile screens are simpler)
4. **No Filters**: Advanced filtering not implemented (can add filter modals)

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Priority 1 - Essential
- [ ] Add student enrollment screen
- [ ] Implement timetable creation
- [ ] Add fee plan management

### Priority 2 - Nice to Have
- [ ] Bulk operations (multi-select and delete)
- [ ] Export data to CSV/Excel
- [ ] Advanced search and filters
- [ ] Photo uploads for admins/students
- [ ] Push notifications for operations

### Priority 3 - Advanced
- [ ] Offline support with local database
- [ ] Biometric authentication
- [ ] QR code generation for quick access
- [ ] Data analytics and reporting
- [ ] Audit logs for all operations

---

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "School code not found"
- **Solution**: Ensure user profile has valid `school_code` field

**Issue**: "Access Denied"
- **Solution**: User role must be 'superadmin' exactly (case-sensitive)

**Issue**: Picker doesn't show options
- **Solution**: Install @react-native-picker/picker package

**Issue**: Navigation doesn't work
- **Solution**: Check that routes are added to _layout.tsx

**Issue**: Data doesn't refresh
- **Solution**: Pull down to refresh or check network connection
