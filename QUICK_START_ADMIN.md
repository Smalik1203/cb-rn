## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Access Denied" Message
**Cause**: User is not a super admin
**Solution**: Check that `profile.role === 'superadmin'` in database

### "School Code Not Found"
**Cause**: User profile missing `school_code`
**Solution**: Ensure user record has valid `school_code` field

### Dropdowns Don't Work
**Cause**: Picker package not installed
**Solution**: Already installed! If issues persist, run:
```bash
npm install @react-native-picker/picker
```

### Data Doesn't Load
**Cause**: Network issue or RLS policy
**Solution**: 
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify Supabase RLS policies allow read access
3. Pull down to refresh

### Can't Create Admin
**Cause**: Edge Function not deployed or permissions issue
**Solution**:
1. Verify `create-admin` Edge Function is deployed
2. Check that current user has permission to call the function
3. Ensure all required fields are filled

## 🔄 Next Steps

2. ✅ **Verify Edge Functions** are working
